This repository contains a demonstration of an uncommon SQL error related to the use of unsupported database functions. The `bug.sql` file contains a query that attempts to use a function not available in the target database system.  The `bugSolution.sql` file provides a corrected version.  This error is often difficult to debug, as the error message can be generic and not immediately point to the unsupported function.
