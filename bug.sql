The SQL query uses a function that is not supported by the database system, such as a custom function or a function from an unsupported extension.  This can lead to a runtime error.  For example, using a function that is only available in MySQL 8.0 in a database running MySQL 5.7.

```sql
SELECT my_custom_function(column1) FROM my_table;
```
